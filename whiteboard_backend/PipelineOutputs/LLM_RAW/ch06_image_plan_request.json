    "content": "Narration text:\nLet's begin by picturing the Golgi apparatus as a stack of flattened membrane-bound sacs, each one called a cisterna, organized with a clear front and back; the side facing the endoplasmic reticulum is the cis face, the middle layers are the medial cisternae, and the side facing the plasma membrane is the trans face. >2.0 This polarity is not just anatomical; it is fundamental to how the Golgi processes and sorts proteins, because different enzymes are localized to different cisternae and molecules progress through the stack in an ordered way. >2.0 Think of it like an assembly line where each station has a specific set of tools that perform particular modifications as cargo moves from the cis end to the trans end. >1.5\n\nFunctionally, the sequence begins when transport vesicles arriving from the ER fuse with the Golgi at the cis face, delivering newly synthesized proteins and lipids into the Golgi system. >2.0 As the cargo moves through the medial cisternae, it encounters sequential enzyme-mediated modifications — for example, trimming of sugar chains and then extension or remodeling of those glycans, along with other post-translational changes. >2.0 These modifications are tightly ordered because the enzymes that carry them out are compartmentalized; a sugar trimming step happens in one cisterna, and a sugar addition step happens in the next. >1.5 Once the molecules reach the trans-Golgi network, the Golgi sorts them into different vesicles for delivery to their final destinations: lysosomes, the plasma membrane, or secretion outside the cell. >2.0 Sorting involves recognition signals on the cargo and sorting receptors that package cargo into the appropriate budding vesicles. >1.5\n\nTo make that concrete, let’s walk through a specific example step by step: a lysosomal hydrolase synthesized in the rough ER is transported to the Golgi in a COPII-coated vesicle and enters at the cis face. >2.0 In the Golgi lumen, that enzyme undergoes a specific modification: a mannose residue on its N-linked glycan is phosphorylated to become mannose-6-phosphate — this is the tag that identifies it as a lysosomal enzyme. >2.0 Once the mannose-6-phosphate tag is added, the hydrolase is recognized by mannose-6-phosphate receptors in the trans-Golgi network and is packaged into clathrin-coated vesicles that bud from the TGN. >2.0 Those vesicles are directed to late endosomes and eventually deliver the hydrolase to the lysosome where the enzyme becomes active and performs degradation functions. >2.0 That sequence — tagging in the Golgi, recognition by receptors, packaging into targeted vesicles, and delivery to the lysosome — illustrates both processing and sorting in action. >1.5\n\nNow let’s summarize some of the trafficking rules that govern which coatings and routes vesicles take, with a short explanation for each. >1.5 COPII-coated vesicles mediate anterograde transport from the ER to the Golgi, forming at ER exit sites to shuttle newly made proteins forward. >1.5 COPI-coated vesicles generally mediate retrograde transport from the Golgi back to the ER, retrieving escaped ER residents and recycling Golgi enzymes or membranes. >1.5 Clathrin-coated vesicles are important for trafficking from the trans-Golgi network to endosomes, and also for endocytosis at the plasma membrane; clathrin helps shape the budding vesicle and select cargo via adaptor proteins. >2.0\n\nQuick check for understanding: can you name one destination for proteins processed in the Golgi? >1.0 And what specific tag targets enzymes to the lysosome? >1.5 Take a moment to think about those answers. >2.0\n\nNow we will examine the cell's energy centers: mitochondria and, in photosynthetic eukaryotes, chloroplasts. >2.0\n\nReturn the JSON image plan now."
