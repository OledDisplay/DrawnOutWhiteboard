    "content": "Narration text:\nLet's begin by focusing on the nucleus and its central role in the cell. >1.5 The nucleus houses the cell's genetic material, the DNA, and serves as the primary site where the instructions encoded in that DNA are read and acted upon. >1.5 It is where transcription occurs—the process of making RNA copies from DNA templates—and it organizes chromatin to regulate which genes are accessible for transcription. >2.0 In short, the nucleus contains DNA, is the site of transcription, organizes chromatin, and plays a key role in regulating gene expression. >2.0\n\nNow I will describe the nucleus's structure step by step so you can picture how form supports function. >1.5 First, the nuclear envelope: this is a double membrane that physically separates the nuclear contents from the cytoplasm. >1.5 The two membranes create a barrier but are punctuated by nuclear pores, specialized openings that control exchange between nucleus and cytoplasm. >2.0 Inside, you can find the nucleolus, a dense region where ribosomal RNA, or rRNA, is synthesized and ribosomal subunits begin to be assembled. >1.5 Surrounding the DNA is chromatin, which is DNA packaged with proteins—mainly histones—so the genome can be compacted and regulated. >2.0 Finally, lining the inner face of the nuclear envelope is the nuclear lamina, a meshwork of intermediate filament proteins that provides structural support and also helps organize chromatin and nuclear pores. >2.5\n\nNext, let's walk through how transcription and RNA processing occur inside the nucleus and how that leads to exported messages for protein synthesis. >1.5 Transcription starts when a gene's DNA sequence is copied into a primary transcript we call pre-mRNA. >1.5 This pre-mRNA contains both exons, which will remain in the final message, and introns, noncoding sequences that must be removed. >2.0 Splicing is the process that removes introns and joins exons to form a contiguous, mature mRNA. >1.5 Additional processing steps occur as well, such as 5' capping and 3' polyadenylation, which protect the mRNA and help with translation and export. >2.0 Once fully processed, the mature mRNA is recognized by export factors and transported out of the nucleus through the nuclear pores to the cytoplasm where it can be translated. >2.5\n\nTo make this concrete, consider the path of a secreted protein, like an antibody or a hormone that must be exported from the cell. >1.5 The gene encoding that protein is transcribed in the nucleus to produce pre-mRNA, which is processed into mature mRNA as I just described. >1.5 The mature mRNA is then exported through nuclear pores into the cytoplasm. >1.5 In the cytoplasm, ribosomes initiate translation, and because the protein is secreted, the ribosome is directed to the rough endoplasmic reticulum by a signal sequence on the emerging peptide. >2.0 Translation continues at the rough ER, where the nascent protein enters the ER lumen or embeds in the membrane, undergoes folding and modifications, and is packaged into vesicles for transport through the Golgi and ultimately to secretion. >2.5 So the explicit path is: transcription in the nucleus, RNA processing, export through nuclear pores, translation at the rough ER, and then trafficking through the secretory pathway. >2.5\n\nLet's pause for a quick check of understanding. >1.5 What types of molecules pass through nuclear pores? >2.0 Take a moment to think about it. >2.0 The answers include mRNA, ribosomal subunits, certain proteins such as transcription factors and enzymes that enter the nucleus, and small ions and signaling molecules that need to move between compartments. >2.0 Does that match what you thought? >1.5\n\nAnother quick question: what is synthesized in the nucleolus? >1.5 Again, pause and consider. >2.0 The nucleolus is the site of rRNA synthesis and the initial assembly of ribosomal subunits. >1.5 If you answered rRNA and ribosomal subunits, that's correct. >2.0\n\nWith the nucleus making instructions, the endoplasmic reticulum and ribosomes produce proteins—let's examine them next. >2.5\n\nReturn the JSON image plan now."
