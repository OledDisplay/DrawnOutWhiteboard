    "content": "Narration text:\nToday we’re going to focus on the cytoskeleton and how intracellular transport happens inside eukaryotic cells. >1.5\n\nFirst, let me list the main components of the cytoskeleton and give you clear definitions for each. >1.2\n\nMicrofilaments, also called actin filaments, are thin polymers made from actin monomers; they form flexible but strong filaments that are concentrated beneath the plasma membrane and are key for cell shape and movement. >2.0\n\nIntermediate filaments are a diverse group of rope-like fibrous proteins that provide tensile strength and mechanical integrity to cells, resisting stretching and mechanical stress. >2.0\n\nMicrotubules are hollow tubes built from tubulin subunits; they form rigid tracks that radiate from organizing centers and help position organelles, provide structural support, and serve as highways for motor-driven transport. >2.5\n\nNow let’s take a closer look at microtubules. >1.0\n\nMicrotubules are polymers of alpha- and beta-tubulin heterodimers; these subunits stack head-to-tail to give the filament inherent polarity, which means each microtubule has a distinct plus end and minus end. >2.0\n\nThe minus end is typically anchored at the microtubule organizing center, like the centrosome, whereas the plus end is more dynamic and usually grows or shrinks more rapidly. >1.8\n\nMicrotubules exhibit dynamic instability, which means individual filaments switch stochastically between phases of growth and rapid shrinkage; this behavior allows the cell to remodel its cytoskeleton quickly in response to needs. >2.5\n\nBecause microtubules are polarized, they serve as directional tracks for motor proteins. >1.2\n\nDynein is a motor protein that generally moves cargo toward the minus end of a microtubule, which is usually toward the cell center; kinesins are a large family of motor proteins that, in most cases, move cargo toward the plus end, toward the cell periphery. >2.5\n\nThis directional movement is crucial for organizing organelles, moving vesicles, and positioning the mitotic spindle during cell division. >1.5\n\nLet’s turn to actin filaments now. >1.0\n\nActin filaments form by polymerization of globular actin monomers into a two-stranded helical filament and, like microtubules, actin filaments are polarized with distinct barbed and pointed ends that have different assembly dynamics. >2.5\n\nA dense network of actin directly underlies the plasma membrane and is often called the cell cortex; this cortex supports cell shape, provides resistance to deformation, and organizes membrane proteins. >2.0\n\nActin dynamics drive many forms of cell motility: for example, polymerization at the leading edge pushes the membrane forward during cell migration, and coordinated actin remodeling allows cells to change shape and move. >2.0\n\nActin also plays a central role in cytokinesis: a contractile ring composed of actin filaments and myosin II assembles at the future division site, then myosin-driven contraction of that ring pinches the cell into two daughter cells. >2.5\n\nNext, intermediate filaments. >1.0\n\nIntermediate filaments provide mechanical support; they form networks that span the cytoplasm and connect to cell junctions and the nucleus, helping cells withstand mechanical stress without breaking. >2.0\n\nThere are different types of intermediate filament proteins expressed in different tissues—for example, keratins in epithelial cells and vimentin in many mesenchymal cells—each suited to the mechanical needs of that cell type. >2.0\n\nBecause intermediate filaments are less dynamic than actin or microtubules, they serve as stable structural elements that maintain cell integrity over longer timescales. >1.8\n\nNow we’ll go step by step through vesicular transport, integrating how cargo gets moved within the cell. >1.2\n\nStep one: cargo is selected and loaded into a forming vesicle; this often involves cargo receptors and coat proteins that shape the membrane and capture specific cargo molecules. >2.0\n\nStep two: motor proteins don’t usually bind the membrane directly; adaptor proteins or coat components link motor proteins to the vesicle, so a motor can attach and exert force. >2.0\n\nStep three: once the motor is bound, the motor moves the vesicle along a microtubule track — for example, kinesin toward the plus end and dynein toward the minus end — carrying cargo to the appropriate cellular region. >2.5\n\nStep four: when the vesicle reaches the target area, tethering factors first capture and hold the vesicle near the target membrane, increasing the probability of correct docking. >1.8\n\nFinally, SNARE proteins on the vesicle and on the target membrane pair up to drive tight docking and membrane fusion, allowing the cargo to be delivered into the target compartment or the extracellular space. >2.5\n\nLet’s do a quick mini-check to make sure the important motor proteins are clear. >1.0\n\nCan you name the motor proteins that move along microtubules and indicate which direction each moves relative to microtubule polarity? >1.5\n\nThink about dynein and kinesin — which goes to the minus end and which generally goes to the plus end? >2.0\n\nWith transport and structure covered, we'll integrate processes: membrane transport, signaling, and homeostasis. >2.0\n\nThat sets us up for the next section where we’ll connect these structural and transport mechanisms to how cells maintain internal balance and respond to external signals. >1.8\n\nReturn the JSON image plan now."
