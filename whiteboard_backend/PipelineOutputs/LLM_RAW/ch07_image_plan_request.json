the cycle completes the oxidation of carbon atoms and produces additional reduced carriers — primarily NADH and FADH2 — plus a small amount of ATP (actually GTP) by substrate-level phosphorylation. >2.5\n\nThose reduced carriers, NADH and FADH2, feed electrons into the electron transport chain, which is embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane. >1.5 As electrons move through the chain’s complexes, the released energy is used to pump protons from the matrix into the intermembrane space, creating a proton gradient across the inner membrane. >2.0 That gradient represents stored energy, often called the proton-motive force. >1.5 ATP synthase, a large membrane protein also embedded in the inner membrane, allows protons to flow back into the matrix and harnesses that flow to synthesize ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate. >2.5 So to summarize the spatial arrangement: the citric acid cycle and the enzymes that generate NADH/FADH2 operate in the matrix, the electron transport chain sits on the inner membrane, the pumping creates a high proton concentration in the intermembrane space, and ATP is made as protons return to the matrix through ATP synthase. >2.0\n\nIt’s also important to note that mitochondria have their own genome and their own ribosomes, separate from the nuclear genome and cytosolic ribosomes. >1.5 This genetic and translational autonomy is one of the core observations that led to the endosymbiotic origin hypothesis: the idea that mitochondria evolved from an ancestral free-living bacterium that established a symbiotic relationship inside a host cell long ago. >2.5 The hypothesis explains why mitochondria retain DNA and bacterial-like ribosomes and why their membranes and some replication features resemble prokaryotic cells. >1.5\n\nIf we look at chloroplasts in plants and algae, we see a similar theme of compartmentalized energy conversion. >2.0 Chloroplasts contain stacks of membrane disks called thylakoids, which form thylakoid membranes. >1.5 The intervening space inside these stacks is the thylakoid lumen, and the fluid surrounding the thylakoid membranes is the stroma. >1.5 Light-dependent reactions occur in the thylakoid membranes: photons drive electron flow through photosystems and an electron transport chain, producing ATP and the reduced carrier NADPH while pumping protons into the thylakoid lumen to create a proton gradient. >2.0 Those ATP and NADPH molecules are then used in the Calvin cycle, which takes place in the stroma, to fix carbon dioxide into sugars. >2.0\n\nLet’s make this concrete with an example calculation for mitochondrial ATP yield from one glucose molecule, remembering that these numbers are approximate and depend on shuttle systems and cell type. >2.0 Glycolysis yields a net of 2 ATP directly and produces 2 NADH in the cytosol. >1.5 Each pyruvate converted to acetyl-CoA yields 1 NADH, so for two pyruvates that’s 2 more NADH. >1.5 The citric acid cycle, running twice per glucose (one turn per acetyl-CoA), yields about 2 ATP (as GTP), 6 NADH, and 2 FADH2 in total. >2.0 Altogether then, from one glucose you commonly count about 10 NADH and 2 FADH2 that can be oxidized by the electron transport chain. >1.5 If we use the standard P/O estimates — roughly 2.5 ATP per NADH and 1.5 ATP per FADH2 — oxidative phosphorylation would produce about 25 ATP from the NADH and about 3 ATP from the FADH2. >2.0 Adding the 4 ATP produced directly by glycolysis and the TCA gives a grand total around 32 ATP per glucose. >2.0 Some estimates are slightly lower, around 30 ATP, because cytosolic NADH from glycolysis sometimes yields fewer ATP entering mitochondria, but this breakdown helps you see where the ATP comes from. >2.5\n\nQuick check for understanding: where, specifically, is the proton gradient formed in mitochondria — in the matrix or the intermembrane space? >1.5 And which mitochondrial membrane houses the electron transport chain and ATP synthase complexes? >1.5 Take a moment and answer that to yourself. >2.0\n\nEnergy produced in mitochondria and chloroplasts doesn’t stay there; it’s delivered and used throughout the cell. >1.5 Now we’ll move on and look at the organelles responsible for digestion and recycling within the cell. >2.0\n\nReturn the JSON image plan now."
