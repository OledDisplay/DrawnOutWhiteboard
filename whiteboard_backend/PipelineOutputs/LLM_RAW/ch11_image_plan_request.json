it is actively regulated by checkpoints and a biochemical engine built from cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases, or CDKs. >1.5 Cyclins are proteins whose concentrations rise and fall in a predictable pattern during the cycle. >1.5 CDKs are kinases that are present more steadily, but they only become active when bound to the appropriate cyclin partner. >1.5 When activated, a cyclin-CDK complex phosphorylates specific target proteins to trigger the cellular events required to advance the cycle — for example, initiating DNA replication or promoting the breakdown of the nuclear envelope. >2.0 So the rise and fall of cyclin levels, together with regulatory phosphorylation and dephosphorylation steps, act like switches that drive the cell through distinct phases. >1.5\n\nOne concrete example of checkpoint control is the G1 DNA damage checkpoint. >1.5 If DNA damage is detected in G1, sensor proteins activate signaling pathways that stabilize proteins such as p53 in many animals, and this leads to increased expression of CDK inhibitors. >1.5 Those inhibitors prevent the formation or activity of G1/S cyclin-CDK complexes, effectively putting the cell cycle on hold so the damage can be repaired. >1.5 If repair is successful, the inhibitors are removed and the cell can progress into S phase; if damage is too severe, the pathway can trigger programmed cell death. >2.0 This is an example of how checkpoints preserve genomic integrity by coupling surveillance to cell-cycle machinery. >1.5\n\nNext I’ll take you step by step through mitosis, outlining what happens to chromosomes and the mitotic spindle in each phase. >2.0 We’ll go slowly so you can visualize the sequence. >1.5\n\nProphase is the first visible stage of mitosis. >1.5 During prophase the chromatin, which in interphase is a more diffuse complex of DNA and proteins, condenses into discrete, compact chromosomes, each consisting of two sister chromatids joined at a centromere. >1.5 At the same time, the mitotic spindle begins to form: centrosomes, or microtubule-organizing centers in animal cells, separate and nucleate microtubules that will eventually capture chromosomes. >1.5 This condensation and early spindle formation prepare the cell for the next step. >1.5\n\nPrometaphase follows when the nuclear envelope breaks down. >1.5 With the nuclear membrane disassembled, spindle microtubules can extend into the former nuclear space and attach to specialized protein structures at the centromeres called kinetochores. >1.5 Kinetochores form on each sister chromatid and serve as the physical link between chromosomes and spindle microtubules. >1.5 Microtubules attach, detach, and reattach in a search-and-capture process until proper bipolar attachments are achieved, with each sister chromatid connected to microtubules from opposite spindle poles. >1.5\n\nMetaphase is the stage where chromosomes are lined up. >1.5 The spindle has established tension across sister chromatids, and all chromosomes are positioned at the metaphase plate — an imaginary plane equidistant from the two poles. >1.5 This alignment is crucial because the checkpoint at the metaphase-to-anaphase transition monitors attachment and tension; only when all chromosomes are properly bi-oriented does the cell proceed. >1.5\n\nAnaphase is the dramatic separation phase. >1.5 The cohesin proteins that held sister chromatids together are cleaved, allowing sister chromatids to separate and become independent chromosomes. >1.5 Motor proteins and shortening of microtubules pull the separated chromatids toward opposite spindle poles. >1.5 The cell elongates as polar microtubules push the poles apart, ensuring that each future daughter cell will receive an identical set of chromosomes. >1.5\n\nDuring telophase, events reverse aspects of prophase. >1.5 Nuclear envelopes reform around the two sets of separated chromosomes, nucleoli reappear, and the chromosomes begin to decondense back into the less compact chromatin state. >1.5 The spindle disassembles, and the cell prepares for the final physical separation. >1.5\n\nFinally, cytokinesis divides the cytoplasm. >1.5 In animal cells this is achieved by a contractile ring of actin and myosin that constricts the cell membrane to form a cleavage furrow, pinching the cell into two. >1.5 In plant cells, where a rigid cell wall prevents furrowing, vesicles coalesce at the center of the cell to build a new cell plate that will become the separating wall. >1.5 At the end of cytokinesis you have two daughter cells, each with a full complement of chromosomes and the potential to enter G1 and repeat the cycle. >2.0\n\nNow, briefly contrast mitosis with meiosis so you understand their different outcomes. >1.5 Meiosis is a specialized form of cell division that reduces the chromosome number by half to produce haploid gametes from a diploid parent; this is why we call it a reduction division. >1.5 A key early event in meiosis I is homolog pairing: homologous chromosomes — one inherited from each parent — recognize and align with each other. >1.5 During prophase I, these paired homologs undergo recombination or crossing over, where corresponding segments of DNA are exchanged. >1.5 Recombination increases genetic diversity in gametes and also helps ensure proper segregation of homologs at the first meiotic division. >1.5 So unlike mitosis, which produces two genetically identical diploid daughter cells, meiosis produces four genetically distinct haploid cells. >2.0\n\nLet’s do a quick mini-check to make sure the sequence and concepts are clear. >1.5 First question: can you order the mitotic phases from the earliest visible stage to the last event of division? >1.5 If you said prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase, then cytokinesis, you are correct. >1.5 Second question: when exactly does DNA replication occur relative to mitosis? >1.5 If you answered S phase, which is part of interphase before mitosis, that’s correct — DNA is duplicated in S, not during mitosis itself. >2.0 If you mixed that up and thought DNA replication happens during mitosis, remember that mitosis is about partitioning already-replicated chromosomes; replication is completed beforehand in S phase. >1.5\n\nTo connect theory to practice, we’ll discuss microscopy and simple lab observations you can perform. >1.5 We’ll move on to how to visualize cells in different cell cycle stages, what stains and markers reveal about chromatin and spindles, and straightforward classroom experiments to observe mitosis frequency and effects of cell-cycle inhibitors. >2.0\n\nReturn the JSON image plan now."
