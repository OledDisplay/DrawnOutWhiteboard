    "content": "Narration text:\nLet's begin by defining the lysosome, because understanding its structure and function sets the stage for everything that follows in this chapter. >1.5 A lysosome is a membrane‑bound organelle that contains a suite of hydrolytic enzymes specialized for breaking down macromolecules—proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and complex carbohydrates—so that their building blocks can be recycled by the cell. >2.0 Importantly, the lysosome maintains an acidic interior, typically around pH 4.5 to 5, and that low pH is critical because those hydrolytic enzymes are optimized to work in an acidic environment. >1.5 The acidity is actively maintained by a proton pump called the V‑ATPase, which uses ATP to transport protons into the lysosomal lumen against their concentration gradient, and that continuous pumping is what keeps the internal environment acidic even as materials are delivered and products are exported. >2.0\n\nNow let’s walk through the major pathways that deliver cargo to lysosomes, because cells use several different routes depending on the origin and size of the material being degraded. >1.5 First, endocytosis brings extracellular material into the cell in small vesicles formed from the plasma membrane; those early endosomes mature into late endosomes, which then fuse with lysosomes so their contents can be degraded. >2.0 Second, autophagy handles intracellular components: portions of the cytosol, damaged organelles, or protein aggregates are sequestered by a double‑membrane structure called the autophagosome, which then fuses with lysosomes for content degradation. >2.0 Third, phagocytosis is used by specialized cells such as macrophages and neutrophils to engulf large particles—bacteria, dead cells, or debris—into large phagosomes that mature and ultimately fuse with lysosomes to produce a phagolysosome where digestion occurs. >2.5\n\nLet me describe the fusion process step by step, because the membrane trafficking and maturation events are precise and coordinated. >1.5 When cargo enters by endocytosis, the vesicle first becomes an early endosome marked by specific Rab GTPases and distinct phosphoinositide lipids; as the endosome matures it undergoes changes in membrane composition and internal pH, becoming a late endosome. >2.0 During this maturation Rab proteins are exchanged, intralumenal vesicles form by inward budding, and the organelle moves along microtubules toward the perinuclear region where lysosomes are concentrated. >2.0 Fusion with the lysosome requires tethering factors and SNARE proteins on both organelles; these proteins mediate close membrane apposition and membrane merger so that the lysosomal hydrolases and the acidic environment can access the cargo. >2.0 In the case of an autophagosome, a similar sequence occurs: the completed autophagosome is transported and docks with a late endosome or directly with a lysosome, SNAREs and tethers facilitate fusion, and the inner contents are exposed to lysosomal enzymes for degradation. >2.5\n\nShifting gears, let’s talk about peroxisomes and how they differ from lysosomes. >1.5 Peroxisomes are single‑membrane organelles whose prominent roles include β‑oxidation of very long‑chain and branched fatty acids, and detoxification reactions that generate hydrogen peroxide as a byproduct. >2.0 To prevent damage, peroxisomes contain catalase and other peroxidases that rapidly convert hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen, protecting the rest of the cell from oxidative harm. >1.5 A key point about peroxisomes is that most of their proteins are imported post‑translationally from the cytosol: newly synthesized peroxisomal enzymes have targeting signals that are recognized by cytosolic receptor proteins, which then ferry them to the peroxisome membrane and translocate them into the lumen. >2.0 This post‑translational import allows fully folded proteins to enter peroxisomes, which is different from how proteins are imported into mitochondria or the ER. >1.5\n\nTo make these pathways concrete, let’s run through an example: how a damaged mitochondrion is removed by autophagy and delivered to the lysosome for degradation. >1.5 When a mitochondrion becomes dysfunctional—losing membrane potential or accumulating damage—sensors in the cell can tag it for selective autophagy, a process often called mitophagy. >2.0 Proteins on the mitochondrial surface become ubiquitinated or recruit autophagy receptors, and those receptors bind LC3 or other autophagosomal membrane proteins, nucleating formation of a phagophore that engulfs the damaged mitochondrion. >2.0 The phagophore closes to form an autophagosome that completely sequesters the mitochondrion, and the autophagosome is then transported toward lysosomes where tethering and SNARE‑mediated fusion occur. >2.0 Once fusion happens, lysosomal enzymes degrade the mitochondrial proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, and the breakdown products are recycled back into the cytosol for reuse. >2.5\n\nLet’s do a quick check for understanding: which organelle is primarily responsible for degrading worn‑out organelles, and which organelle breaks down hydrogen peroxide? >1.5 If you said the lysosome degrades worn‑out organelles and the peroxisome breaks down hydrogen peroxide via catalase, you’re correct. >2.0\n\nFinally, one more transition to guide you to the next topic: the structural organization and movement of these organelles depends heavily on the cytoskeleton, and we’ll explain that system in the next chapter. >2.0\n\nReturn the JSON image plan now."
