    "content": "Narration text:\nToday we're going to focus on the cellular machines that make proteins and send them into the secretory pathway: ribosomes and the rough endoplasmic reticulum. >1.5\n\nLet's begin with ribosomes themselves. >1.0 Ribosomes are macromolecular complexes made of ribosomal RNA and many different ribosomal proteins; they are not membrane bound and they assemble from a large and a small subunit. >1.5 There are two functional populations to keep in mind: free ribosomes, which float in the cytosol and synthesize proteins that usually remain in the cytosol or are targeted to organelles like mitochondria or the nucleus, and membrane-bound ribosomes, which are attached to the cytosolic face of the rough endoplasmic reticulum and synthesize proteins that will be secreted, inserted into membranes, or resident in the endomembrane system. >2.0 Free and bound ribosomes are structurally similar — the same basic rRNA-protein architecture — but their location and the fate of the proteins they produce differ. >1.5\n\nNow let’s walk through translation step by step so you can picture how a polypeptide is built. >1.0 Translation begins when an mRNA molecule binds to a ribosome, positioning its start codon in the ribosome’s P site. >1.5 Transfer RNAs, each charged with a specific amino acid and carrying an anticodon complementary to the mRNA codon, enter the ribosome and base-pair with the mRNA. >1.5 As each new charged tRNA arrives in the A site, a peptide bond forms between the growing polypeptide on the tRNA in the P site and the incoming amino acid. >1.5 The ribosome then shifts, moving the tRNAs and the mRNA so the next codon is positioned for decoding; the empty tRNA exits and the newly elongated peptidyl-tRNA occupies the P site. >2.0 This cycle of codon recognition, peptide-bond formation, and translocation repeats, and the polypeptide elongates one amino acid at a time. >1.5 As the chain grows, portions of it begin to fold, often co-translationally, meaning the nascent polypeptide starts adopting secondary and tertiary structure even before synthesis is complete. >1.5 Eventually a stop codon is reached, release factors promote termination, and the completed polypeptide is released to fold further or to be targeted to its destination. >2.0\n\nNext, I want you to understand the signal sequence concept because it explains how some proteins are directed to the rough ER while they are still being synthesized. >1.0 A signal peptide is a short stretch of hydrophobic amino acids, usually at the N-terminus of the nascent chain, that acts like a postal code telling the cell this protein needs to enter the secretory pathway. >1.5 The process that follows is called co-translational translocation — the targeting and transfer of a nascent polypeptide into the ER as it is being made. >1.5 To make this crystal clear, let’s walk through the sequence of events and number them. >1.0\n\n1) Recognition: As soon as the signal peptide emerges from the ribosome’s exit tunnel, it is recognized by a cytosolic complex called the signal recognition particle, or SRP. >1.5 SRP binds both the signal sequence and the ribosome, and this binding temporarily halts translation. >1.5\n\n2) Docking: The SRP–ribosome–nascent chain complex is targeted to the ER membrane, where it binds to an SRP receptor embedded in the ER membrane. >1.5 At this docking site the ribosome is handed off to a protein-conducting channel in the ER membrane called the translocon. >1.5\n\n3) Translocation: Once the ribosome is engaged with the translocon, SRP dissociates and translation resumes. >1.5 As the ribosome continues to synthesize the polypeptide, the new amino acids are threaded through the translocon directly into the ER lumen or into the membrane, depending on the protein's topology. >2.0\n\nSo those are the key steps: recognition, docking, and translocation. >1.5 Notice how translation is paused and then resumed once the ribosome is properly positioned — that coordination is essential to ensure the nascent chain does not fold in the cytosol or end up in the wrong compartment. >2.0\n\nNow let’s describe what happens inside the rough ER once a polypeptide is translocated. >1.0 The rough ER provides an environment specialized for the folding and initial processing of proteins destined for secretion or for membranes. >1.5 Molecular chaperones in the ER lumen help newly arrived polypeptides fold correctly; these chaperones, for example BiP in the ER, bind exposed hydrophobic patches to prevent aggregation and to assist proper folding. >2.0 The ER is also the site of initial N-linked glycosylation, where specific oligosaccharide chains are attached to asparagine residues in the consensus sequence asparagine-X-serine/threonine; this glycosylation can influence folding, stability, and recognition by quality control machinery. >2.0 Quality control systems in the ER check that proteins are properly folded; misfolded proteins are retained and, if they cannot fold correctly, are targeted for degradation via mechanisms such as ER-associated degradation. >1.5 Once a protein is properly folded and modified, it is packaged into transport vesicles that bud from specialized ER exit sites; those vesicles carry the cargo to the Golgi apparatus for further processing. >2.0\n\nLet’s make this concrete with a well-known example: insulin biosynthesis. >1.0 Insulin is synthesized as a single precursor polypeptide called preproinsulin. >1.5 The preproinsulin sequence includes an N-terminal signal peptide that directs the ribosome–nascent chain complex to the rough ER. >1.5 After docking and translocation, the signal peptide is cleaved off in the ER, converting preproinsulin to proinsulin. >2.0 In the ER lumen proinsulin folds and forms disulfide bonds, and initial folding and any necessary glycosylation steps are monitored by chaperones. >1.5 Properly folded proinsulin is then packaged into vesicles and sent to the Golgi, where further processing and sorting occur; ultimately proinsulin is processed to mature insulin and stored in secretory granules for regulated secretion. >2.0 This example illustrates how synthesis in the rough ER links directly to folding, quality control, and onward trafficking. >1.5\n\nQuick check for understanding: where is a membrane protein’s transmembrane domain inserted — in the cytosol or in the ER membrane? >1.5 Think about how the translocon works and where hydrophobic stretches end up. >1.0 The answer is that the transmembrane domain is inserted into the lipid bilayer of the ER membrane during co-translational translocation. >1.5 The translocon provides a lateral gate that allows hydrophobic segments to move sideways into the membrane, so they become integral membrane spans rather than being translocated into the lumen. >2.0 If you thought the cytosol, that would be incorrect; the ribosome and translocon coordinate so hydrophobic domains are deposited directly into the ER bilayer as the chain is synthesized. >1.5\n\nProteins leave the ER in vesicles and travel to the Golgi—next we'll detail the Golgi's role. >2.0\n\nReturn the JSON image plan now."
